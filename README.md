# Reproducing Switch Scheduling Research
Our project focuses on reproducing research related to switch scheduling. 
In particular, we focus on algorithms for input-queued switches that offer
solutions for the head-of-line blocking problem switch scheduling algorithms
contend with.

The main algorithm that we reproduce is the iSLIP algorithm but we also
reproduce
